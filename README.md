# HSE Lab 3
This is my programming course lab with some basic data structures, an interesting CMake config with library fetching, a Capybara-ASCII-Art pic and auto tests (using GoogleTest lib) with nice test coverage.

## Building
```bash
$ mkdir build
$ cd build 
$ cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release ..
$ make
```
